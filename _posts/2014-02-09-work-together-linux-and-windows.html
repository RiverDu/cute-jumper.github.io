<p>
Currently I have <b>three</b> laptops. They have Arch Linux, Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu
Linux 13.10 installed respectively. The laptop with the Ubuntu is four years old
and not quite usable because it has heat dissipation problem and would easily
shutdown when running some CPU-consuming programs. But still, it could be used
as a file server and run some light-weight workload.
</p>

<p>
Besides the laptops, I have a 27-inch 1080p IPS LED monitor. When working, I
would use Arch Linux on my HP ultrabook and the 13-inch QHD screen is gorgeous.
However, since I have done some HiDPI-related settings on KDE(my desktop
environment on Arch Linux) as described in <a href="{% post_url 2014-01-26-install-arch-linux-on-hp-spectre-13t3000 %}">this post</a>, it would become very ugly
if I connect the ultrabook to the 27-inch monitor, whose DPI is only 81.59.
Therefore I prefer connecting the Windows 8.1 machine to the monitor. The
problem here is how to make these machines cooperate with each other.

<h3 id="orgb047024"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Server</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The first thing I want to set up is to access files on another machine over the
local network. I use a fairly simple <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a> setup. The following steps are based
on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba">this Arch Wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
First install <code>samba</code> and <code>smbclient</code>. Copy the example configuration file
<code>/etc/samba/smb.conf.default/</code> to <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>. I only changed the line
below:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">name resolve <span style="color: #ff8700;">order</span> = lmhosts bcast host wins
</pre>
</div>
<p>
because of the "Time Out" problem of Dolphin mentioned in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba#KDE">this section</a>. But the
Dolphin's built-in Samba support is still very unusable. It is very slow and
often can not even show the Samba server list completely. I use the command line
tool <code>smbclient</code> instead.
</p>

<p>
In Arch's example configuration file, it enable user's home directory sharing by
default. The situation of Ubuntu is a little different. You need to manually
uncomment the <code>[homes]</code> part in <i>Share Definitions</i>. Now start the Samba server
using <code>systemctl start smbd nmbd</code> and make them enable by default using
<code>systemctl enable smbd nmbd</code>.
</p>

<p>
Next we need to grant users' access to the Samba drives. Using
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">smbpasswd -a qjp
</pre>
</div>
<p>
will add the user <code>qjp</code> to the local smbpasswd file, and we can log into Samba
drives as user <code>qjp</code> now. The server settings are all done.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org73b2e09" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org73b2e09"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Client</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Essentially there are no apparent settings required in client side. To see some
useful information of a Samba server:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">smbclient -L hostname -U username
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we manually mount the remote drive to a local mountpoint, using one of the
sharenames you see in the output of previous command:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">sudo mount -t cifs //hostname/sharename /path/to/mountpoint -o
<span style="color: #ff8700;">user</span>=username,<span style="color: #ff8700;">password</span>=password,<span style="color: #ff8700;">workgroup</span>=WORKGROUP,<span style="color: #ff8700;">uid</span>=localusername,<span style="color: #ff8700;">gid</span>=localgroupname,<span style="color: #ff8700;">ip</span>=serverip
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since this command is executed using <code>sudo</code>, the <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code> options are
necessary as I want write-permission to the mountpoint as a regular user <code>qjp</code>,
not <code>root</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d3e572" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0d3e572"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> A Use Case</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Now let us see a use case of how to work effectively by using Linux and Windows
together.
</p>

<p>
I use \LaTeX{} to generate pdf files in Linux, and with a plugin named
<code>latex-preview-pane</code> of Emacs, the pdf file will be automatically regenerated
every time I save the modified \LaTeX{} source file. In order to make use of the
large screen of the 27-inch monitor, I want to write \LaTeX{} source file in my
ultrabook while viewing the generated pdf file in the Windows machine, which is
connected to the 27-inch monitor.
</p>

<p>
While <code>Evince</code> and <code>Okular</code> all support auto-reloading of pdf files when they
are changed in Linux, I only find that <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/download-free-pdf-viewer.html">Sumatra PDF</a> has the similar functionality
in Windows(It is also said the <code>Evince</code>'s Windows version has the auto-reloading
feature but it doesn't work properly when I tested it). The problem here is when
using Sumatra to view the pdf file in the drive of my Linux machine via Samba,
Sumatra will not automatically reload the pdf file when I regenerate it. It is
<b>not</b> wierd because in the OS level, the <i>file change notification</i> isn't sent
to the Sumatra in time, that is, Sumatra doesn't know that this pdf file has
already been regenerated so it won't reload it. It is Samba's fault. From
Samba's documentation <a href="http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/using_samba/ch11.html">here</a>, there is actually a global option in the Samba
server, named <code>change notify timeout</code>, which defaults to 60 seconds. Making this
number smaller seems to solve this problem. However, the documentation said
"Performing these checks too often can slow down the server considerably", so it
is not feasible to make it small enough in order to achieve the effect of
instant updating of the pdf files.
</p>

<p>
Currently the best solution I could think of is to synchronize the generated pdf
file between Linux and Windows. Then Sumatra will open the pdf file locally, and
every time I regenerate the pdf file in Linux, the file should be copied to
Windows instantly. The file synchronization tools such as Dropbox are not fast
enough to achieve this, so writing a simple shell script would be better. There
is a package named <code>inotify-tools</code> in Arch's official repository, which contains
a tool that could monitor the state changes of a particular file or directory.
You could find some examples <a href="https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki">here</a>. The script I use for this case is really
simple:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">inotifywait -m -e close_write example.pdf | <span style="color: #a1db00;">while </span><span style="color: #d18aff;">read</span> foo; <span style="color: #a1db00;">do</span> cp example.pdf
/path/to/mountpoint/Documents/example.pdf; <span style="color: #a1db00;">done</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>inotifywait</code> will monitor the <code>close_write</code> events of <code>example.pdf</code>. Once it is
regenerated, copy the new file to Windows via Samba. Then Sumatra will reload
the new pdf file. This process is very fast.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org548e2ec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org548e2ec"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Share keyboard and Mouse Between Laptops</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In order to switch between different laptops seamlessly, I need to control the
Windows on the other laptop using the keyboard and mouse of my Linux ultrabook.
The first solution I thought of was to install a third-party VNC server on
Windows(I have to do so because there is no built-in support in Windows 8.1,
which is neither a pro nor enterprise version, to act as a remote desktop
server) and use a VNC client to connect to the server so that I could use my
keyboard and mouse of my Linux ultrabook to control the Windows. I could put the
VNC client in a separate activity of KDE to make the switch more comfortable.
</p>

<p>
The above solution seems quite good, except that I don't really need to view the
Windows desktop in the VNC client since I have the large-size monitor already.
It is a waste to transfer the data and consume the CPU computation power.
Luckily, I found <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/281262/remote-control-linux-keyboard-mouse">this thread</a> on superuser, which said that <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">Synergy</a> was good to
solve this. Actually, it is. We could easily install it from Arch's official
repository. Follow the instructions on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/synergy">this page</a> to set up the server on Arch
Linux. You could use the example configuration file,
<code>/etc/synergy.conf.example</code>, or the GUI tool to generate the configuration file.
I manually edited the <i>aliases</i> section to associate the hostnames with their
corresponding IP addresses so that it is unnecessary to change the <code>hosts</code> file
of the operating system.
</p>

<p>
I would make the Windows machine act as the client. However, at the time of
writing, the lastest version, 1.4.15 Beta, still doesn't fix the bug of
<i>alt+tab</i> mentioned in <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/spit/issues/details/3338/">this issue</a>. But someone else in that issue thread has
already fixed that and applied his/her patch to version 1.4.14, which would make
the <i>alt+tab</i> behave normally in Windows 8. You could find the download
addresses for the patched versions in that issue. I'm suprised that the author
doesn't apply that patch, which was quite simple and came out earlier than the
new version was released.
</p>

<p>
After using Synergy for a while, I would say it is really a great piece of
software. It is very fast. The Windows machine behaves like the extended desktop
for my Linux. I could simply move the cursor to switch between them, which is
really awesome.

<p>
OK. These are all my settings to make use of multiple laptops together. I could
now take advantage of both Linux and Windows to finish different kinds of tasks.
Most of my working is done under Linux, and Windows is mainly used for
entertainment and viewing Microsoft Office documents. I also have the high DPI
screen as well as the large Full HD screen to work at the same time, which makes
working at home really an enjoyment. Every available device now works very well,
except for the old and poor Ubuntu laptop. It could only serve as a internal
file server and SSH server. Up until now, I couldn't think of anything
interesting to make use of it:(.
