<p>
I'll give a brief summary of the Emacs packages I've written so far. All of
them are fairly simple:-). You can find them on <a href="http://melpa.org">Melpa</a>, except for my fork of
<a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/matlab-mode">matlab-mode</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the list of packages I've written so far:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/gscholar-bibtex">gscholar-bibtex</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/emacs-firefox-controller">firefox-controller</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'll give a brief and not-too-technical introduction to each package and share
some personal feeling about the packages. For detailed usage for a package,
please find the corresponding GitHub README file.

<p>
<i>Retrieve BibTeX entries from Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore and DBLP</i>.
</p>

<p>
Strangely, before I wrote <a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/gscholar-bibtex">gscholar-bibtex</a>, there was no pure Elisp package
that supported to download BibTeX entries from Google Scholar directly. Some
Python or Perl scripts did exist, but I don't think we need the help from
other scripting languages, which introduces unnecessary dependencies. And
although <a href="https://github.com/pzorin/bibretrieve">bibretrieve</a> supports to download BibTeX entries from various sources,
Google Scholar is not supported and personally speaking, I don't like the way
that <a href="https://github.com/pzorin/bibretrieve">bibretrieve</a> does: it only fetches BibTeX entries. In some cases, it is
hard to figure out whether the fetched BibTeX entry is what we want due to the
lack of certain context. On the other hand, if we fetch too often from Google
Scholar, our IP will be banned! I used to encounter such situations very often
when I ran <a href="https://github.com/venthur/gscholar/">gscholar</a>, a Python script which does similar things.
</p>

<p>
So what <code>gscholar-bibtex</code> does is: first it asks you for the keyword to
search, then it displays the search results with the title and the excerpt.
Users can select a result and preview the corresponding BibTeX entry. If that
is what he/she wants, store the BibTeX entries to the database or some other
file. The whole process is pretty much like what you would do in a web
browser, but the workflow is simplified and it is implemented only in Emacs
Lisp so is tightly integrated into Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Later I added support for ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore, and thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/liblit">Liblit</a>, we also got support for DBLP. The package right now is pretty stable.
For future improvements, I would like to investigate <a href="https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex">helm-bibtex</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a> a
little bit to find the possibilities to integrate these packages.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">avy</a> is one of the most important Emacs extensions I have ever used. Jumping to
anywhere in the screen using <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">avy</a> is super fast. However, at the time I started
to write these packages, it was <a href="https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode">ace-jump-mode</a> that provided such
functionalities, and at first <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo">abo-abo</a> didn't plan to release =avy=(See <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link/pull/10">here</a>.
He changed his mind later, which is really a good decision!). You can notice
that some of the packages I've written have <code>ace-</code> in their names. That's
simply because originally I wrote these packages as an extension for
<code>ace-jump-mode</code>, although most of them now supports <code>avy</code> or actually uses
<code>avy</code>.

<i>Jump to Chinese character by pinyin with <code>ace-jump-mode</code> or <code>avy</code></i>

<p>
This package supports <code>ace-jump-mode</code> and <code>avy</code>. It's a real pain that <code>avy</code>
only supports English and we can't use <code>avy</code> to jump to Chinese characters
since I use <code>avy</code> heavily to navigate in files. Then I found
<a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/find-by-pinyin-dired">find-by-pinyin-dired</a> by <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/find-by-pinyin-dired">Chen Bin</a>, and inspired by this package, I wrote
<code>ace-pinyin</code>. As long as <code>ace-pinyin-mode</code> is enabled, we can jump to either
English or Chinese characters, using either <code>ace-jump-mode</code> or <code>avy</code>.
</p>

<p>
For Japanese users, <a href="http://rubikitch.com/2015/04/18/ace-pinyin/">this article</a> provides a way to use <code>ace-pinyin</code> in
Japanese, and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/erstern">erstern</a>, we got support for traditional Chinese
characters!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
<i>Jump to and correct spelling errors using ace-jump-mode and flyspell</i>
</p>

<p>
This package is inspired by abo-abo's <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link/">ace-link</a>. Once you have enabled
<code>flyspell-mode</code>, you can jump to an error found by <code>flyspell</code> using
<code>ace-jump-mode</code>. If you're using the command <code>ace-flyspell-dwim</code>, provided in
this package, you can further fix the error and jump back to where you are in
the beginning after you accept the fix. See this demo for the command
=ace-flyspell-dwim=(it is a little out of date though):
</p>
<img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/ace-flyspell/raw/master/screencasts/ace-flyspell-dwim.gif" width="90%"/>

<p>
I use <code>ace-flyspell-dwim</code> very often. If <code>flyspell</code> finds a spelling error, I
can quickly jump to the misspelled word, fix it and jump back. I feel the
least interrupt during my writing using such a method.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, right now this package is still using <code>ace-jump-mode</code>, and
some features that I've planned haven't been added. For most of my use cases,
it is good enough now, but I would like to use <code>avy</code> as the backend and add
more features to it.

<i>Ace-jump to a candidate in helm window</i>

<p>
This is another simple, naive, yet useful package. <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/anything.el">anything.el</a> has a similar
function but <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a> gets rid of it.(May not be true now, see <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/1257">here</a>). The
original idea is proposed by hick(I don't know your link, sorry). To select a
candidate in helm quickly, we can invoke <code>ace-jump-helm-line</code>, using the
similar interface as <code>avy-goto-line</code>, to jump to a candidate. Another command
is <code>ace-jump-helm-line-execute-action</code>, which will execute the persistent
action after jumping to a candidate.

<i>Zap to char using <code>avy</code></i>

<p>
This package is basically a fork of the functionality of <a href="https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap">ace-jump-zap</a>, but
using <code>avy</code> instead of <code>ace-jump-mode</code> as the jumping method. Yeah, finally a
package named with <code>avy</code>!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
In terms of the extensibility, <code>avy</code> is much better than <code>ace-jump-mode</code>
since it is fully synchronized. In <code>ace-jump-mode</code>, you have to rely on the
hooks to run some custom functions, and there is a high probability that
different packages may interfere and conflict with each other because the
developers may not take care of the hooked functions used by other packages.
Also, it is generally easier to do some complicated things and get the code
right when using the fully synchronized way provided by <code>avy</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>ace-jump-mode</code> is not longer maintained. Using <code>avy</code> instead, and thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/">abo-abo</a> for this awesome package(and his other packages such as <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">hydra</a> and

In addition to <a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/ace-pinyin">ace-pinyin</a>, I have also written some other packages, which
might be useful especially for Chinese users.

<p>
<i>Make fcitx better in Emacs</i>
</p>

<p>
In Vim, <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/fcitx.vim">fcitx.vim</a> helps toggle <a href="https://github.com/fcitx">fcitx</a> in normal mode and insert mode, and in
Emacs, we have <code>fcitx.el</code>, which adds the same functionalities to <code>Evil</code>, and
besides, we have extra features for prefix keys and minibuffer input.
</p>

<p>
User can set up the package either by <code>fcitx-default-setup</code> or
<code>fcitx-aggressive-setup</code>. The difference between <code>fcitx-default-setup</code> and
<code>fcitx-aggressive-setup</code> is that the latter completely disables <code>fcitx</code> in
the minibuffer. For users who spend most of their time typing Chinese only in
buffers, I suggests to use <code>fcitx-aggressive-setup</code>.
</p>

<p>
As I'm not a hardcore Evil user, and most of the time I'm using Emacs key
bindings, personally speaking, I like the prefix keys features most. It can
disable <code>fcitx</code> after the user presses some certain prefix keys, such as
<code>C-x</code> and <code>C-c</code>, so that the next single letter input, say <code>b</code>, will not
block by <code>fcitx</code>.
</p>

<p>
For OSX users, who don't have <code>fcitx</code> available, install
<a href="https://github.com/CodeFalling/fcitx-remote-for-osx">fcitx-remote-for-osx</a>. It is compatible for both <code>fcitx.el</code> and
<code>fcitx.vim</code> (modified version, see the project's README).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
<i>Emacs company-mode backend for QML</i>
</p>

<p>
The package name explains almost everything if you know what is <a href="https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode">company-mode</a>.
In fact, <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete/">auto-complete</a> comes with a dictionary-based <code>QML</code> completion, while
<code>company-mode</code> doesn't. However, you can simply use the <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete/blob/master/dict/qml-mode">dictionary</a> in
<code>auto-complete</code> and add all the keywords in the dictionary to
<code>company-keywords-alist</code> so that <code>company-keywords</code> backend is able to
complete these keywords. However, I wanna achieve something a little more
intelligent.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a simple parser to parse the information provided in
<code>plugins.qmltypes</code> files, which can be generated by <code>qmlplugindump</code>. After
parsing type information, the company backend should be able to utilize the
extracted type information. Several screenshots:
</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/company-qml/raw/master/screenshots/object.png" width="90%"/></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/company-qml/raw/master/screenshots/field.png" width="90%"/></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/company-qml/raw/master/screenshots/global.png" width="90%"/></p>

<p>
Using <code>plugins.qmltypes</code> is very flexible. If you want completions for other
libraries, say, if you are writing plugins for Plasma, you can feed the
<code>plugin.qmltypes</code> file to the parser. As far as I know, QtCreator takes a
similar approach.
</p>

<p>
It is quite usable, but far from perfect for the time being. I would like to
improve it in the near future. Several possible improvements that are on my
top TODO list for this package are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Simplify the configuration process. For example, provide out-of-box
completions for QML files using standard QML libraries. Extra settings are
only needed when you need completions for third-party libraries.</li>
<li>Better QML parser. For example, support nested object completions(current
only one nested level) and <code>as</code> in <code>import</code> statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Javascript support will be considered a little bit later.

<i>Major mode for editing GMPL(MathProg) files</i>
</p>

<p>
When I decided to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">glpk</a> for the project in my Linear Programming course, I
was surprised to see that Emacs had no support for GNU MathProg(GMPL), which
is the mathematical programming language used to describe models that can be
solved by <code>glpk</code>. Before writing this major mode, I found <a href="https://github.com/dpo/ampl-mode">ampl-mode</a> on GitHub,
but it has poor support for GMPL files, e.g., keywords not highlighted
properly, some GMPL syntaxes are not supported, and its indentation function
is too simple to indent my code correctly.
</p>

<p>
So here comes <code>gmpl-mode</code>, and this is how it looks like using Emacs 24’s
builtin theme <code>tsdh-dark</code>:
</p>
<img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/gmpl-mode/raw/master/screenshot.png"  width="90%"/>

<p>
If you only need to solve linear programs, you can use <kbd>C-c
C-c</kbd> to call <code>gmpl-glpsol-solve-dwim</code>. The solutions and the
sensitivity report will be shown in a new buffer. I also added some
<code>font-lock</code> keywords to the solution buffer, so the key parts of the solutions
can be recognized very quickly.

<i>An improved Firefox controller for Emacs</i>
</p>

<p>
Wow, control Firefox from Emacs, cool idea, huh?
</p>

<p>
You have two different modes to choose: <code>firefox-controller-direct-mode</code> and
<code>firefox-controller-remote-mode</code>. <code>firefox-controller-direct-mode</code>, as the
names suggests, you can control the Firefox as if you are currently in
Firefox, while your Emacs window keep the current focus of your window
manager. All the keys you pressed will be processed by Firefox, except for
some special keys. <code>firefox-controller-remote-mode</code>, on the other hands,
provides some commands and binds these commands to a short key sequence. The
keys pressed are processed by Emacs and Emacs remotely controls the Firefox.
</p>

<p>
Confused? See the screenshots!
</p>

<p>
Here is the screenshot for <code>firefox-controller-direct-mode</code>:
</p>
<img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/emacs-firefox-controller/raw/master/screenshots/direct-mode.gif" width="90%"/>

<p>
What on the earth am I doing here? First I invoke
<code>firefox-controller-direct-mode</code>. After that I type
<kbd>C-l</kbd> to go to the address bar, and use
<kbd>M-g</kbd> to highlight my current location(which is the
address bar of course). Then go to google.com, and use
<kbd>M-g</kbd> again to confirm the current focused element
in firefox is the search box. After I type and search "emacs", I use
KeySnail's plugin <a href="https://github.com/mooz/keysnail/raw/master/plugins/hok.ks.js">hok</a> to jump to a link and open it.
</p>

<p>
And what about <code>firefox-controller-remote-mode</code>? Here it is:
</p>
<img src="https://github.com/cute-jumper/emacs-firefox-controller/raw/master/screenshots/remote-mode.png" width="90%"/>

<p>
Instead of using your Firefox key bindings, you can use the previous key
bindings to control Firefox, like what we do when using a TV remote
controller! This mode is good enough for just viewing the web page, but for
tasks like editing text or jumping to a link, go to
<code>firefox-controller-direct-mode</code> and use it with <a href="https://github.com/mooz/keysnail">KeySnail</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note this is a reimplementation of <a href="https://github.com/RenWenshan/emacs-moz-controller">emacs-moz-controller</a> by <a href="https://github.com/RenWenshan/">RenWenshan</a>. It adds
a lot of new features and provides a complete different user interface. Thanks

Thanks to probobis, who added some initial <code>company-mode</code> support for
<code>matlab-mode</code>, but unfortunately, I can't really get <code>company-matlab-shell.el</code>
to work. So I rewrote <code>company-matlab-shell.el</code> to fix many bugs, and added

your own functions. Cool.

I don't create a pull request against the upstream repo since the code is kind

I've written several Emacs packages and contributed a few lines of code to

As an Emacs user, I would like to see more people coming into this community
so that more awesome packages can be obtained! Elisp is not hard to learn if
you have some scripting or functional language experience. I myself comes from
