<p>
I decided to install Arch Linux on my new ultrabook. I have been mainly using
Ubuntu for several years. Since this ultrabook is quite new, I want more control
on it and I think Arch Linux will be more suitable for this case. I also
considered Gentoo, which is more customizable than Arch, but at the end I think
it is not worth wasting so much time on compiling just to gain probably little
performance improvement. In this post, I will talk about installation and
configurations of Arch Linux on my new ultrabook, HP Spectre 13t-3000. Many of
the following steps are from the Arch Wiki, but I think it is still necessary to
write this post because the wiki tries to cover everything while I just need
something useful for me. I would write the instructions that I actually use and
leave out other tedious parts.

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Check the hardware</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Since this ultrabook comes with Windows 8 preinstalled, I first boot into the
Windows 8 and make sure there is no problem with the hardware. It seems that
under Windows 8, everything works fine. The screen is gorgeous, and Windows 8
becomes more easy to use when using the touchscreen. The backlit keyboard is
beautiful, and wireless, audios and everything else all work out of the box.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Make UEFI Bootable USB</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Download the Arch Linux ISO from <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">here</a>. I use my Ubuntu system on an other laptop
to make the UEFI bootalb USB. I have an 8 GB USB as installation medium, and it
was shown as <code>/dev/sdb/</code> in my Ubuntu system using <code>lsblk</code>. The following
command will destroy everything in the USB and make a bootable USB:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdb &amp;&amp; sync
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And that's all. Very easy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Boot the installation medium</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Insert the USB into the new ultrabook, press "Power" button and then <code>F10</code> to
enter the UEFI BIOS settings. Here, I changed three things:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Disable <b>Secure Boot</b>. It is really <b>USELESS</b> for a Linux user now and it
will cause some unnecessary troubles during installation.
</li>
<li>Enable <b>Intel VT-x</b>. I would install virtual machines on my laptop and this
feature is certainly essential.
</li>
<li>Boot order. Make USB prior to disk.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Installation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Now we will enter the Arch live environment. It is just a shell. Arch
installation medium uses <code>Zsh</code> as default shell, which will simplify a lot of
typing during installtion. The default keyboard layout(US), language(English)
and wired Internet connection(DHCP) all work for me. Although this ultrabook has
no Ethernet port, I have a USB 3.0 hub with Ethernet port. So I was actually
using wired Internet now. I didn't need to make any changes for these settings.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Creat Partitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Using <code>lsblk</code>, I can see that the disk of the ultrabook was shown as
<code>/dev/sdb/</code>. Through following steps, I will delete all the original partitions
and only create a <code>/</code> partition for Arch Linux. Since it is a UEFI motherboard,
I also need to create an extra partition for <b>EFI System Partition(ESP)</b>.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>gdisk /dev/sdb</code>
</li>
<li><code>d</code>. Repeat multiple times to remove all the partition on the disk.
</li>
<li><code>N</code>. The first sector is default, the last sector is <code>+1024M</code>, and the <code>Type</code>
is <code>ef00</code>. This partition is for ESP.
</li>
<li><code>N</code>. Make all the rest to be the root <code>/</code> partition.
</li>
<li><code>w</code>. Apply all the changes.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Swap partition is not necessary. After installation, you can use swap file and
it is more flexible because you can easily resize it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Create Filesystems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
I still use <code>ext4</code> as my root filesystem although I do want to try <code>Btrfs</code>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Mount the partitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Next, we need to mount the partition as we are going to install the system on
the newly created partitions.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we make a new directory <code>/mnt/boot</code> and mount the ESP to it:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Install Base System</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
We are now going to actually install Arch.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When this command ends, a basic Arch Linux is already installed! Let's now do
some necessary configrations.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Some Necessary Configurations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
First we generate the <code>fstab</code> file:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">genfstab -U -p /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You might check the <code>/mnt/ect/fstab</code> file as it is highly recommended by the
Arch Wiki.
</p>

<p>
Next, <code>chroot</code> into the new system:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Well, now we are going to use <code>bash</code>, which is kind of hard to use as an
interactive shell compared to <code>Zsh</code>.
</p>

<p>
I will also need a Chinese locale. So:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">vi /etc/locale.gen
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Uncomment the line of <code>zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8</code>, then use <code>locale-gen</code> to generate new
locales.
</p>

<p>
Next, create a <code>/etc/locale.conf</code> file:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 &gt; /etc/locale.conf
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And export it:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can change time zone by:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/&lt;Zone&gt;/&lt;SubZone&gt; /etc/localtime
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Change the hostname(you can also use the <code>hostnamectl</code> command):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">echo 'hp-spectre' &gt; /etc/hostname
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For wired Internet connection, I only need dynamic IP now:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Set the password for root:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">passwd
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For the moment, I think the above configurations are enough and let's now
install a bootloader.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Install a Bootloader</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
Instead of <code>grub</code>, <code>gummiboot</code> is recommended for UEFI motherboards. Install <code>gummiboot</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
pacman -S gummiboot
gummiboot install
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we need to manually create an file under <code>/boot/loader/entries/</code>. Let's say
it's <code>arch.conf</code>. Add following contents to it:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">title   Arch Linux
linux   /vmlinuz-linux
initrd  /initramfs-linux.img
options root=/dev/sda2 rw
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note here the root should be <code>/dev/sda2</code>, not <code>/dev/sdb2</code> because when you
normally boot the system without the USB installation medium, the disk of the
ultrabook should be <code>/dev/sda/</code> although right now it was <code>/dev/sdb/</code>.
</p>

<p>
OK. The installation of Arch Linux is finished. Up until now, we only use a few
very basic shell commands, and it should be quite easy even for someone who only
has limited knowledge about Linux.
</p>

<p>
Let's reboot and go to the tedious configuration part.:(
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">reboot
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Configure the System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
After rebooting, we can login as root using the password, and the wired Internet
should work. The USB installation medium is useless now and you can remove it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Add a User</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
let's first install <code>sudo</code> and <code>zsh</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S sudo zsh
visudo
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Uncomment the following line:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Add a user named "qjp", make it a member of group "wheel" and use <code>zsh</code> as the
login shell:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/zsh qjp
passwd qjp
</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Change Settings of Pacman</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
I probably will use some x86 applications on my x64 system, so I need to enable
the <code>multilib</code> repository. Just uncomment the <code>multilib</code> section in
<code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> and run a force fresh of package list:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -Syy
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Install GUI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
First we need to instal X Window System and <code>mesa</code> for 3D support:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S xorg-server xorg-server-utils xorg-xinit mesa
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Install Intel's video driver:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S xf86-video-intel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We need the following package in order to make the touchscreen and touchpad work
properly:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S xf86-input-synaptics
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Because of the high DPI screen(13.3-inch QHD screen), I decided to use KDE
Plasma Desktop. Currently it has the best support for HiDPI screen among all the
mainstream desktop environments. Since I want to have the entire KDE software
compilation, based on this <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE_Packages">article</a>, it is better to install KDE by:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S kde-meta
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then enable the KDE Dispaly Manager(KDM):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">systemctl enable kdm
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In order to display Chinese properly, install following fonts for Chinese:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>wqy-bitmapfont
</li>
<li>wqy-zenhei
</li>
<li>ttf-arphic-ukai
</li>
<li>ttf-arphic-uming
</li>
<li>ttf-fireflysung
</li>
<li>wqy-microhei
</li>
<li>wqy-microhei-lite
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Reboot, and in less than 5 seconds(really, really fast!), we should be able to
see a login window and we can login as 'qjp' and start using the GUI now!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Wireless connections</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
After entering KDE, I found everything on the screen was still so small. This
didn't bother me so much right now because I had been working in a small
terminal up until now and kind of got accustomed to it. KDE can't automatically
adjust itself according to current DPI. So we still need to manually change its
settings. But wait a minute, let's first connect to the Internet via wireless
networks.
</p>

<p>
At first, I was attempting to use a graphical network manager. I tried <code>wicd</code>
but it didn't always work. Actually I only succeeded connecting to the wireless
networks a few times using <code>wicd</code>. So I finally gave up and turned to Arch's
default command-line tools.
</p>

<p>
First install some essential packages:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we use <code>wifi-menu</code> to set up wireless networks:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">wifi-menu
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select the corresponding interface and wireless network. Enter password if
necessary. My wireless interface name is <code>wlo1</code>. The above command will result
in a configuration file under <code>/etc/netctl/</code>. Usually the file name has the form
of <code>interfacename-networkssid</code>. Enable the wireless network named "mynetwork" of
interface <code>wlo1</code> using:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">netctl enable wlo1-mynetwork
</pre>
</div>

<p>
At Penn State, the <code>psu</code> wireless uses WPA2-Enterprise for authentication, which
is not as easy to configure as WPA2-Personal. Combining <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl#Eduroam">this trick</a> on Arch Wiki
and the instructions on <a href="http://wireless.psu.edu">http://wireless.psu.edu</a>, this configuration file works
for me:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Description='Automatically generated profile by wifi-menu'
Interface=wlo1
Connection=wireless
Security=wpa-configsection
ESSID=psu
IP=dhcp
WPAConfigSection=(
	'ssid="psu"'
	'key_mgmt=WPA-EAP'
	'eap=TTLS'
	'anonymous_identity="your_psu_access_id"'
	'identity="your_psu_access_id"'
	'password="your_psu_access_id_password"'
	'ca_cert="/etc/ssl/certs/AddTrust_External_Root.pem"'
	'phase2="auth=PAP"'
)
</pre>

<p>
I also installed <code>wpa_actiond</code> and <code>ifplugd</code> for automatic switching of
profiles. Just enable the services and they will switch between multiple
profiles automatically:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">systemctl enable netctl-auto@wlo1.service
systemctl enable netctl-ifplugd@eth0.service
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, if I choose <code>netctl-auto</code> to automatically manage the profiles, I need
to run <code>netctl disable wlo1-mynetwork</code> to disable the profiles that I have
enabled using <code>netctl</code>, otherwise these profiles will start twice at boot.
Currently wireless networks work properly and the background service
automatically handles everything for me.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-5"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> High DPI Settings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
KDE has great support for HiDPI screen, although there are still some <a href="https://community.kde.org/KDE/High-dpi_issues">issues</a>.
We mainly need to adjust the setting of two parts:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Font and icons
</li>
<li>Theme
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Below are my settings:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go to <i>System Settings-&gt;Application Appearance-&gt;Icons-&gt;Advanced</i>, and change
the icon size to <code>128</code>.
</li>
<li>In the same window, go to <i>Fonts</i>, check <i>Force fonts DPI</i>, and set its value
to <code>172</code>. Also change the font sizes of toolbar, window title and Taskbar all
to <code>9</code>.
</li>
<li>Edit <code>$HOME/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>, and change the hintstyle from
   <code>hintmedium</code> to <code>hintslight</code>.
</li>
<li>Go to <i>System Settings-&gt;Workspace Appearance-&gt;Window Decorations-&gt;Configure
Decoration&#x2026;-&gt;General</i>, and change <i>Button size</i> to "Very Large".
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now most KDE applications should look pretty good.
</p>

<p>
For GTK+ applications, install <code>oxygen-gtk2, oxygen-gtk3</code> and <code>kde-gtk-config</code>
packages.
</p>

<p>
In firefox, go to <i>about:config</i> page, and change the value of
<code>layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</code>. I set the value to be 1.7, which is slightly
smaller than: <code>(Current Font DPI)/96=172/96=1.8</code>.
</p>

<p>
Neither Chromium nor Google Chrome has HiDPI support under Linux right now
although they do support HiDPI through chrome://flags under Windows.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-6"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> Touchpad</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
The touchpad works properly. However, due to the silly "control zone" design of
HP Spectre 13t-3000, the touchpad is extremely <b>wide</b> and that really bothers me
a lot when I am typing. Add following command to <i>autostart</i> of KDE to disable
touchpad when typing:

<h3 id="sec-3-7"><span class="section-number-3">3.7</span> Audio</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-7">
<p>
To my suprise, audio is the hardest part to configure. At first, I could listen
to local music using headphone. However, I could not make the speaker to work
using <code>alsamixer</code> command from the <code>alsa-utils</code> package. Also, the flash will
also crash. Starting firefox from terminal and then playing flash videos on
youtube, I found the problem was also caused by the audio system. The error
message was something like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1018:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
</pre>

<p>
I googled around, and tried many solutions including adding a <code>$HOME/.asoundrc</code>
file and changing settings in <code>KMix</code>, but still failed. Finally I tried to
install <code>pulseaudio</code> and suprisingly, the vlc player now could play local music
normally. Then I installed <code>pulseaudio-alsa</code> package, which solved the problem
of flash player.
</p>

<p>
Digression: I found the version of flashplayer is older in Arch than that in
Ubuntu, which is kind of amazing because Arch is said to be always to keep
up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
The solutions are far from perfect. Several problems still exist. For example,
the <i>Event Sounds</i> will sometimes automatically be reset to the maximum volumn
without any indication and that really freaks me out. I have to mute it.
</p>

<p>
Besides, I also need to disable the "beep" since it was so annoying. Every time
I type a "tab" in shell and there is no completion, it will make a loud "beep",
which is so silly. Add the following command to <i>autostart</i> of KDE to disable
it!

<p>
I also installed <code>fcitx-sogoupinyin</code> and <code>fcitx-cloudpinyin</code>. The fcitx skin
<i>milk</i> looks great under KDE and is highly recommended. After installing the
skin via fcitx's configuration panel, you need to click <i>Configure Skin</i>, choose
<i>SkinFont</i> tab and check "Font size repect dpi setting", or it will look too
small.

I also disable various shortcuts of fcitx since they will cause collisions

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-9">
<p>
The backlit keyboard works out of the box. In <i>System Settings</i>, I make the
<code>caps lock</code> to be an extra <code>ctrl</code>. This is what I must do in every operating
system I use because I think the place of <code>caps lock</code> is one of the most stupid
designs of the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
The default shortcuts of KDE are so different from Gnome and Unity that I have
to memorize these new bindings again.
</p>

<p>
These are what I set for my KDE shortcuts(I change some original settings):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ctrl+meta+{left,right,up,down}</code> to switch workspaces. I have four workspaces,
which is the same as Unity.
</li>
<li><code>shift+alt+up</code> to maxmize window.
</li>
<li><code>shift+alt+down</code> to minimize window.
</li>
<li><code>shift+alt+{left,right}</code> to quickly tile window to the left or right.
</li>
<li><code>meta+alt+{left,right,up,down}</code> to move current window to a different
workspace.
</li>
<li><code>meta+w</code> to toggle present windows in current desktop
</li>
<li><code>meta+ctrl+{-,=}</code> to decrease/increase opacity of active window by 5%.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Strangely, the "extra ctrl" key <code>caps lock</code> can not be used in shortcuts related
to desktops, such as <code>ctrl+{F1,F2,F3,F4,F8,F10,F12}</code>, but it can be used when
combined with other function keys like <code>ctrl+alt+{left,right,up,down}</code>.

Since I am an Emacs user, so readers can skip this part if you are not.

To support fcitx in Emacs, use following command to launch Emacs:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.UTF8 emacs
</pre>
</div>

I maintain my own Emacs settings in a private repo on <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, and migration
to <a href="https://github.com/cute-jumper/qjp-emacs.d">GitHub</a> is in progress. There are several problems when porting my old
settings to the new one.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I use the latest <code>org</code> package from the <a href="http://orgmode.org/elpa">org mode's elpa</a>. The <code>org mode</code> often
complains <code>Invalid function: org-with-silent-modifications</code>. I found a
solution on <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/70880">this thread</a>: start Emacs with <code>emacs -Q</code>, and then reinstall the
<code>org</code> package. This perfectly solves the problem.
</li>
<li>In order to get rid of the graphcal window when using EasyPG, the following
setting is not enough:
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" nil)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
because Arch uses <code>gnupg2</code> instead of <code>gnupg1</code>. Install <code>gnupg1</code> from AUR,
then add following code to Emacs' settings:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(when (file-executable-p "/usr/bin/gpg1")
  (setq epg-gpg-program "/usr/bin/gpg1"))
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>In Emacs 24.3, the variable <code>last-command-char</code> no longer exists. Replace
this variable with <code>last-command-event</code> in every package that uses this
variable.

<li><del>Ubuntu One. I have been using Ubuntu One for a long time on my old laptop. We need to install Ubuntu One from AUR. After installing it, every time I log into KDE, it will ask for a password for <i>gnome-keyring</i>, which is very annoying. So I install <code>seahorse</code> and change the password to be empty. This is not a <b>safe</b> way. However, it solved the problem.</del>
</li>
<li>SpiderOak. Ubuntu One worked for a while, but it randomly stopped working and
I have no idea why it failed. So I picked <a href="https://spideroak.com/">SpiderOak</a> as its replacement. The
reason why I need such a file synchronization program besides Dropbox: Both
Ubuntu One and SpiderOak could choose to synchronize a folder at where it is,
that is, I don't need to put everything into one "central" folder like Dropbox
does.
</li>
<li>VirtualBox. The kernel module <code>vboxdrv</code> is not automatically enabled so we
need to use <code>modprobe</code> to enable it. The more convenient way is to set up a
file named <code>virtualbox.conf</code> under <code>/etc/modules-load.d/</code> and just put the
line <code>vboxdrv</code> in it.
</li>
<li>Firefox KDE Integration. Install <a href="http://oxygenkde.altervista.org/index.html">Oxygen KDE</a> theme for firefox to make it looks
better under KDE, and install <code>firefox-kde-opensuse</code> from AUR to replace the
official firefox in order to associate proper applications with different file
types.
</li>
<li>Fonts. The google web fonts from AUR is highly recommended.
</li>
<li>Python 3 is set as default in Arch. I currently still work in Python 2.x, so
if installing packages via <code>pip</code>, <code>python2-pip</code> is needed.
</li>
<li>Ruby. RubyGems seems to be installed under personal directory instead of
system directories by default. So it is necessary to modify the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable:
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">PATH=$PATH:$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')/bin
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Scala. Scala-ide is available from AUR.
</li>
<li>By default, KDE will not automatically mount removable devices. You can change
this behavior in <i>System Settings-&gt;Removable Devices</i>.
</li>
<li>Sanguosha is a popular board game in China, and there is a QT-Based sanguosha
application named "qsanguosha". You can install it from AUR if interested.:)

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Conclusion</h2>

Finally, we come into the "Conclusion" part. I think I left out a lot of other
useful settings because I just can't remember them when writing this post!
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, there are no big problems installing (Arch) Linux in this
ultrabook, and nearly everything is great! The booting speed is fantastic(less
than 5 seconds) and the KDE Plasma Desktop looks really beautiful in the QHD
screen.
</p>

<p>
One other important thing I forgot to mention: with screen brightness set to
10%, this ultrabook can work more than 5 hours in KDE. This figure is not quite
good as it is a <b>Haswell</b> based ultrabook. It is said that this ultrabook can at
most have 9 hours under Windows 8. The battery life seemed even worse when
compared to the Macbook Air. Although it fails to meet my original expectations,
given the fact that it runs Linux, I think it is still acceptable.
